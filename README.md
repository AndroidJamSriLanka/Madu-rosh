# App Name - Sportshub

##App Description
There are several live score apps in android studio but this app is different as this will add some added feature like you can put an reminder about the match and the app will show latest news on football and cricket my idea is to build an app to see the score of on going matches here my basic concern will go to Soccer and Cricket.


##What the app does-added features 
following features will be added(or i'll try my mxa to add them all)

--users can search ongoing matches
--they have to ability to see upcoming matches
--they can put reminders for those matches in their phones and get alerts!
--they can get alert messages from app if they follow a series which is happening
